/*
	How to theme the site:
	Place your css/scss here to change the layout of the page
	Copy Variables from 1-settings/globals.scss and paste them here to change them
	Use 'gulp build' to build the theme

	If you want to make some deeper changes, duplicate 7-trumps/theme-default and
	name it to your liking.
	After that add the new file at the bottom of site.scss (look there for
	additonal information)

	This way it's the easiest to stay up to date if there are further changes in
	the repository - which is not unlikely.
